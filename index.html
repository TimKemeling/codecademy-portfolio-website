        <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Tim Kemeling, a 25 year old beginner programmer from The Netherlands. I currently live in Thailand on a 
            small island in the Gulf of Thailand called Koh Tao. I normally work as a scuba diving instructor but since covid 
            I have had little to no work due to a lack of tourism. <br><br>I started programming in june 2021 in search of a online job. 
            So far it has been very interesting and fun to learn! My journey started with learning HTML and CSS trough Codecademy, 
            after that I started their full stack web developer course. The website you are reading right now is also part of that course. <br><br> 
            On this website you will find elements of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. More languages are to be added to my portfolio 
            as I progress trough the course. I hope you enjoy my small but hopefully expanding portfolio website!      
        </p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
            These are the main projects that are on my GitHub page for now, more will be added as I progress trough my career path.
            <ul>
               <li><a href="https://github.com/TimKemeling/excursion">Excursion promotion page</a></li>
               <li><a href="https://github.com/TimKemeling/Mixed-messages">mixed messages</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Excursion promotion page</h2>
        <p>
            This is a codecademy project that is used for practising CSS styling for webpages.
            A picture with page specifications is given to be recreated with little to no further info on how to build the page.
            I personally learned a lot from this since some of the CSS concepts used were still a little bit vague to me.

        <h2>Mixed messages JavaScript project</h2>
        <p>
            This codecademy project is used to practise skills learned in JavaScript. 
            The goal is to generate a random message with a minimun of three randomized inputs. 
            This project was a lot of fun to work on, it gave me a few brainteasers to find the best way to accomplish
            the goal at the end of the project.
        </p>
