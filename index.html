                Hi! I'm Tim Kemeling, a 25 year old beginner programmer from The Netherlands. I currently live in Thailand on a 
                small island in the Gulf of Thailand called Koh Tao. I normally work as a scuba diving instructor but since covid 
                I have had little to no work due to a lack of tourism. I started programming in june 2021 in search of a online job. 
                So far it has been very interesting and fun to learn!
                My journey started with learning HTML and CSS trough CodeCademy, after that I started their full stack web developer 
                course. This website is part of that course as well. In this website you will find elements of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                More languages are to be added to my portfolio as I progress trough the course. I hope you enjoy my small but hopefully 
                expanding portfolio website!
